# Tennis Bracket System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Proper Single-Elimination Bracket Structure**
- **Problem**: Players were getting multiple matches in the same round
- **Solution**: Completely rewrote draw generation to create proper single-elimination brackets
- **Result**: Each player now has exactly one match per round and must win to advance

### 2. **Automatic Bye System**
- **Problem**: No handling of uneven participant numbers
- **Solution**: Implemented automatic byes for top-seeded players when bracket isn't full
- **Example**: With 14 players in a 16-player bracket, the top 2 seeds get byes to the next round

### 3. **Proper Seeding Logic**
- **Problem**: Seeding wasn't based on actual player rankings
- **Solution**: Automatic seeding based on player ranking points
- **Rules**: 
  - Singles: Top 1/4 of participants get seeded
  - Doubles: Top 1/2 get seeded and paired with unseeded players

### 4. **Standard Tennis Tournament Positions**
- **Problem**: Seeds weren't placed in standard tournament positions
- **Solution**: Implemented proper tennis seeding positions
- **Standard Positions**:
  - Seed 1: Top of bracket
  - Seed 2: Bottom of bracket  
  - Seeds 3-4: Middle sections
  - Seeds 5-8: Quarter sections (for larger draws)

### 5. **Automatic Round Progression**
- **Problem**: No automatic creation of next round matches
- **Solution**: When all matches in a round are complete, next round is automatically created
- **Features**:
  - Winners automatically advance to next round
  - Proper bracket position tracking
  - Maintains tournament structure integrity

## How It Works Now

### Draw Generation Process:
1. **Sort players** by ranking points (highest first)
2. **Assign seeds** to top players (1/4 for singles, 1/2 for doubles)
3. **Place seeds** in standard tournament positions
4. **Fill remaining spots** with randomly shuffled unseeded players
5. **Create first round matches** only where both players exist
6. **Players with byes** automatically advance (no match created)

### Match Progression:
1. **Record match result** → Winner advances
2. **Check if round complete** → All matches in round finished?
3. **Create next round** → Automatically generate next round matches
4. **Maintain bracket structure** → Winners placed in correct positions
5. **Continue until final** → Tournament progresses naturally

### Visual Bracket Display:
- **Round-by-round columns** showing tournament progression
- **Color-coded match status** (scheduled, in-progress, completed)
- **Seeding indicators** showing player rankings
- **Bye visualization** (players who advanced without playing)
- **Winner advancement** clearly shown with checkmarks

## Example Tournament Flow

**16-Player Singles Tournament:**
- Round of 16: 8 matches (16 players)
- Quarter-Finals: 4 matches (8 winners)
- Semi-Finals: 2 matches (4 winners)  
- Final: 1 match (2 winners)
- Champion: 1 winner

**14-Player Singles Tournament:**
- Round of 16: 6 matches (12 players) + 2 byes for top seeds
- Quarter-Finals: 4 matches (6 winners + 2 bye recipients)
- Semi-Finals: 2 matches (4 winners)
- Final: 1 match (2 winners)
- Champion: 1 winner
